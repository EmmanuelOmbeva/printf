Printf Project
This project implements a custom version of the printf function in C. The printf function is used to output formatted data to the console, and is a fundamental part of the C programming language.

In this project, we aim to replicate the functionality of the standard printf function, while also adding some custom features and options. Our implementation includes support for formatting strings, numbers, and other data types, as well as a range of formatting options and modifiers.

To get started, simply clone the repository and run the provided test cases. We hope you find our implementation useful, and welcome any feedback or contributions you may have. Happy coding!
